============

1. Fork this repository to your account, then clone it from there.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Compare what you see in your browser to the iOS_7_Weather.png file.  Notice that the image shows a thunderstorm and lots of nicely formatted data, but the code currently shows a sunny background and not-so-nicely formatted output.
4. The HTML is fine, but the code in main.css is missing a lot of CSS.

Can you add the necessary CSS to make the web page look like it should?
